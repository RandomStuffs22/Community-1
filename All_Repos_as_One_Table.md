This is a single-table version of [All Repos].
It provides sortable table with all the repositories in our [GitHub Organization](http://github.com/blackberry),
generated from a backing [JSON file](All_Repos.json).  Also see the list of [All Samples].

The table can be sorted (ascending/descending) on a sequence of one or more columns.  To select additional
columns select the next column while pressing the 'SHIFT' (on mac) key. The table uses these tooltips -
hover over them to learn their meaning:
<span class="question" tip="(Repo column) A list of 'tags' characterizing this repo (useful?)">T</span>, 
<span class="question" tip="(Repo column) Extra information on the branches in the repository">B</span>,
<span class="question" tip="(Repo column) Repo has Pages">P</span>,
<span class="question" tip="(Repo column) Repo has a Wiki">W</span>,
<span class="question" tip="(Desc column) Extra details on the repository">?</span>,
<span class="warning" tip="(Desc column) Issues to resolve">!</span>,
<span class="question" tip="(in BB10 column) Ported to PlayBook but not yet tested on BB10">?</span>,
<span class="question" tip="(in Port column) Extra information on porting">P</span>.

_*Notes*_: We are interested in your feedback on how to best present this information.
